Fork Socket Test
====
A phpunit based integration test for testing socket connecting methods.

The public end of my units lately have often been in a place where the unit connects to some external component: sockets, database, a GUI, etc.

The really testable components have been private members. So this leaves me usually writing unit tests.

My socket tests, until now, have required me to manually set up an ncat somewhere to provide the mock for the far end of the public component that I am testind.

This script is a basic layout that illustrates how I am going to set up these integration tests automatically from now on.

For example, I can program a listener mock to be automatically launched to receive the asserted client's output side effect.

This code also illustrates the simplest functioning echo listener and clients I could mock up for this purpose.
It also demonstrates simple process forking in PHP.
